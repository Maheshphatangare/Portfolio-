      🧑‍💻 About Me
Hello! I'm Mahesh Phatangare, a passionate and detail-oriented software developer. I specialize in building full-stack web applications using technologies like React, Java Spring Boot, and Firebase. I enjoy solving problems through code and turning ideas into real-life applications.

I have a strong foundation in computer science and hands-on experience with both frontend and backend development. I'm always eager to learn new tools, contribute to open-source projects, and collaborate with other developers to create impactful solutions.

Outside of coding, I enjoy exploring new tech trends, reading about software architecture, and improving my skills through continuous learning.
